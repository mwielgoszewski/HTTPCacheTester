HTTPCacheTester is a standalone web server that serves various file types
and allows for the tester to manipulate the setting of various HTTP caching
related headers via submitted GET/POST parameters.

This was created in an effort to identify discrepencies in browsers' handling
of Pragma, Cache-Control and Expires related headers. Popular browsers were
found to *break* when opening files with their respective applications if
downloaded over SSL and/or with certain headers set when the file was served.
